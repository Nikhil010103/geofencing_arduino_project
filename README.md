# GPS-Based Geofencing and Alert System
This project was developed as part of a practicum assignment to implement a real-time location monitoring system. The system is designed to track the movement of a device and detect when it moves outside a predefined geofenced area. If the device crosses the boundary, an alarm is triggered, and an SMS alert is sent to a specified phone number containing the device's current location.

The project utilizes an Arduino Uno as the central controller, along with a GPS module for location tracking and a GSM module for sending alerts. This setup provides a cost-effective and efficient solution for remote tracking applications, such as asset security, vehicle tracking, and personal safety monitoring.
